            <h5>Extraction of Silica Nanoparticles from Fly Ash</h5>
            <p>In my Bachelor of Technology (BTech) project, I focused on extracting silica nanoparticles from fly ash, a byproduct of coal combustion often considered waste. My primary objective was to explore the potential of fly ash as a cost-effective and sustainable source of silica nanoparticles, which have numerous industrial applications. Instead of letting fly ash contribute to environmental pollution, I aimed to utilize it as a valuable raw material for synthesizing nanomaterials.</p><p>The extraction process involved a series of chemical treatments, primarily acid leaching and precipitation, to isolate silica from the complex composition of fly ash. Acid leaching dissolved undesirable impurities while simultaneously separating silica in a more purified form. This was followed by precipitation techniques to obtain silica nanoparticles. Throughout the process, precise control of reaction parameters, such as pH, temperature, and concentration, was crucial to achieve high-purity silica with desirable properties.<p>After successfully extracting silica nanoparticles, I conducted thorough characterization tests to analyze their composition and structure. These tests were conducted at Gauhati University in Guwahati using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). FTIR analysis confirmed the presence of silica by identifying its characteristic functional groups, ensuring that the extraction process had effectively isolated the desired material. Simultaneously, SEM provided valuable insights into the nanoparticlesâ€™ morphology, particle size, and surface structure, helping determine their suitability for various applications.<p>The analyses conducted revealed that fly ash can be effectively processed into high-purity silica nanoparticles with promising structural characteristics. Given the growing demand for nanomaterials across various industries, such as construction, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and environmental remediation, this study highlighted the potential of repurposing industrial waste into valuable resources. Through this project, I not only gained practical experience in chemical processing and nanomaterial characterization but also developed a comprehensive understanding of sustainable material development. The research underscored the viability of fly ash as an alternative source of silica nanoparticles, contributing to waste management initiatives while simultaneously promoting environmentally friendly solutions for industrial applications.</p>
